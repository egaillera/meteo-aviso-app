//
//  Description: this class will hold all the measurements coming from server
//               Together with the measuremnts, it will publish some flags
//               so other views in the app could know if the data:
//                - is available (filled)
//                - has been showed in the map (showed)
//                - there has been a communication error with server (commError)
//                - if we are in process of downloding the data from server (isDataLoading)
//               For now, this class will be instantiated in the SceneDelegate, just
//               after the app starts.
